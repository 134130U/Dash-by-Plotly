Iâ€™m asking my viewers to support my Dash Plotly educational channel. A growing number of viewers are looking for high quality, professional content on Dash, which is hard to find. I am trying to fill that gap. 

My goal is to make this a sustainable project for myself and my viewers, so if you appreciate my channel and are able support its existence, I would be grateful to you.
