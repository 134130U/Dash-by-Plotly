Create your own Virtual Environment
1.	Create a folder where you’d like to store your virtual environment documents (.yml)  
2.	Open Atom or any other IDE (Microsoft Visual, PyCharm, IDLE, etc.) and go into the above folder
3.	Create a new document inside this folder, and save it as  “any-name-you-want.yml”
4.	Give your environment a name
5.	Insert into the document all the dependencies, libraries, and packages you want in your environment
6.	Initiate new terminal and make sure you’re in the directory where the .yml document is located.
7.	To install virtual environment, type into terminal:
conda env create -f any-name-you-want.yml   (your antivirus/firewall might block installation)
8.	Go into any directory where you’d like to start writing code
9.	Activate your virtual environment, using the “name” inside the .yml document:
conda activate env_dash_1_8_0
10.	Enjoy coding! 😊

**   To deactivate/exit your virtual environment, type into terminal: conda deactivate
**   To add more libraries to your environment, activate environment and pip install the library
